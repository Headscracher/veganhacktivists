This has truly been the best year for creating connections and partnerships in the animal protection movement, and we are extremely pleased with the work we've accomplished.</p> <p>This year, we have also prioritized organizing and optimizing internal processes. This was crucial for us since a core focus of 2022 is to expand our volunteer network to meet the demand of our services. We want to continue being able to serve the multifaceted needs of the vegan movement and empower people to become activists.</p> <p>We're really excited to hear your thoughts in our 2021 year in review, and if you like what we do, please consider supporting us by clicking the button below.
