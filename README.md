WIP. Our official website. On here you can find information about the different projects Vegan Hacktivists has been working on throughout the last couple of years. You can also find out what services we provide, who we are, who we partner with and read our blog.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Install the hooks:

```bash
yarn husky install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Configuring the editor

It is recommended to install [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), although the commit hooks will already take care of the formatting.

It is also recommended to activate the `Editor: Format on save` option.
