            We are excited to have a dedicated comms team led by Malina Tran,
            our Director of Communications. This versatile team manages our
            blog, software content, social media, marketing, fundraising and
            grant applicationâ€” and has been vital to our success and growth in
            showcasing the work we do to the public.

            We&apos;ve also made several changes to our team structure! We now
            have a leadership team that includes key roles such as
            communications, product management, operations, engineering, design
            and lead architect supporting various teams and the organization as
            a whole. Branded with an apple (core), of course!

            As our volunteer community has grown, we&apos;ve moved our signature
            team branding to Playground! Each team will specialize in a specific
            role which will allow us to connect volunteers with requests much
            easier. We&apos;re looking forward to building the community further
            there!
